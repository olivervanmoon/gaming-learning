Notes:

super stupid really new note

Board 7 columns, 6 rows




for player in players:
    for square in board: (can optimize for not going to edge)
        if color == square == square(col+1) == square(col+2) == square(col+3):
            return color
        check next 3 diag right
        check next 3 up
        check next 3 diag left
    



Questions:
do I want to use python error handling?








use @property to make board state a property in the Board class that players can access via getter/setter functions that check for a valid move and make the necessary modifications to the board.
use itertools cycle for players
use dictionary to associate player with id and name etc 



everything is going to be taken over by machine learning ai . . .
