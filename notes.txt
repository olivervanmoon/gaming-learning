Notes

To do:

implement computer players: random (done), perfect, learning

make a log file





Learned:

git highest level directory: git rev-parse --show-toplevel

add all known files git add -A (captial A)
commit all known files: git commit -a

traceback.print_stack()

solved game = a game where outcome is predictable from any state based on players making perfect moves
minimax = choose move that minimizes loss

@property decorator helps make setter/getter functions with rules for objects

itertools cycle

To Check Out:
what is git reset?
python logging module
python libraries for (game) machine learning, GANs
game trees and minimax alg?
static methods
dictionaries


Questions:
do I want to use python error handling?
if i put board in game, do I have to always be doing game.board?
do you use github cli?
